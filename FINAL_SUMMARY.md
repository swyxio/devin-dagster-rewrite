# Final Project Summary: Airflow to Dagster Migration

## Overview

This document serves as the final summary for the migration of an Airflow project to Dagster, detailing the process, testing, and documentation updates. The original Airflow project repository is located at [soggycactus/airflow-repo-template](https://github.com/soggycactus/airflow-repo-template).

## Migration Details

- Airflow DAGs and custom operators were translated into Dagster jobs and resources.
- The `dagster_solids.py` file contains the implementation of Dagster jobs equivalent to the original Airflow tasks.
- A Dagster resource, `example_hook_resource`, was created to mimic the Airflow `ExampleHook`.

## Testing Procedures

- Each Dagster job was tested using the `execute_in_process` method to ensure functional parity with the original Airflow tasks.
- Scripts `execute_custom_operator_job.py`, `execute_example_job.py`, and `execute_tutorial_job.py` were created to facilitate the execution and testing of the respective jobs.
- Job execution logs were reviewed to confirm successful completion and correct behavior.

## Documentation Updates

- The `README.md` file was updated to reflect the migration process and provide a guide for users to interact with the new Dagster setup.
- Instructions for installing Dagster and Dagit, running jobs, and using the Dagit UI were included.
- The documentation emphasizes the full reimplementation of the original Airflow functionalities in Dagster without any placeholder code.

## Conclusion

The migration from Airflow to Dagster has been completed, with all functionalities of the original project fully reimplemented in Dagster. The updated documentation provides all necessary information for users to run and interact with the Dagster jobs.

## Next Steps

- Users are encouraged to review the updated `README.md` for instructions on running the Dagster jobs.
- Contributions to further enhance the project are welcome, following the guidelines provided in the original Airflow project repository.

## Acknowledgements

We thank the contributors of the original Airflow project for providing a solid foundation for this migration effort.
